# Hi, I'm Akseli! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- I am a Software Engineer with experience working at an early stage startup. I have experience building/shipping/maintaining a production application using languages like React and TypeScript.

<!--
## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- In my role as a Junior Front-End Developer at a private startup, I've honed my skills in React, React Router Dom, Material UI, and Firebase services such as Firestore, Authentication, Hosting, Cloud Functions, and Storage.
- A few of my responsibilities encompassed performance optimization, pagination, crafting user-friendly interfaces, and implementing security measures with OAuth and writing backend security rules.
- Notably, I have developed a custom form builder, an admin dashboard, effectively managed multiple user types with distinct permission levels across the application and have built an ever growing list of features for this app.

# Hi, I'm Akseli! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- I am a dedicated software engineer with a diverse background spanning various industries. My journey into software engineering began with a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, followed by hands-on experience in front-end development using React and Firebase. 
- In my recent role as a Junior Front-End Developer at a startup, I led the development of a collection management system, handling tasks ranging from performance optimization to security implementation. My career reflects adaptability, problem-solving, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, acquired through prior roles in logistics, sales, and service.
- With my versatile skill set and experience, I am eager to contribute to innovative web applications as I continue my career in software engineering.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- In my role as a Junior Front-End Developer at a private startup, I've honed my skills in React, React Router Dom, Material UI, and Firebase services such as Firestore, Authentication, Hosting, Cloud Functions, and Storage.
- A few of my responsibilities encompassed performance optimization, pagination, crafting user-friendly interfaces, and implementing security measures with OAuth and writing backend security rules.
- Notably, I have developed a custom form builder, an admin dashboard, effectively managed multiple user types with distinct permission levels across the application and have built an ever growing list of features for this app.
